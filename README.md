<p align=justify>Project in which I developed my first shopping cart in ReactJS. I created the website from a fictitious eyeglasses store with the items being loaded dynamically, using the useState hook to store which items are active in the cart and useEffect to update the total purchase value. With this project I improved my skills with React, working with basic and advanced concepts of this powerful tool.</p>
